Answer exactly 'BEST: P#' on a single line. If tie, list comma-separated (e.g., BEST: P1,P2).\n\n\nSolution 1:\n\nBEST: P1\n\n\nInstruction 2 (More Difficult):\n\nYou are an AI assistant that helps to evaluate the efficiency of different pathfinding algorithms in a complex facility with multiple rooms and obstacles. The facility has 10 rooms, each with a unique reward value, and some rooms have obstacles that require specific keys to unlock. The keys are located in other rooms. The goal is to maximize the total reward while collecting all keys.\n\n\nFacility Layout:\n\nRoom 1: Reward 10, Key to Room 3\n\nRoom 2: Reward 5"
