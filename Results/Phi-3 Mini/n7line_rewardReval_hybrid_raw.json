Answer exactly 'BEST: P#' on a single line. If tie, list comma-separated (e.g., BEST: P1,P2).\n\n\nSolution 1:\n\nBEST: P3\n\n\nInstruction 2 (More Difficult):\n\nYou are an AI assistant that helps to evaluate the efficiency of different pathfinding algorithms in a complex facility with 10 rooms. The facility has the following constraints:\n\n- Each room has a unique reward value, ranging from 1 to 10.\n- Some rooms have doors that lead to other rooms, but not all rooms are connected.\n- The facility has a time limit for traversing the rooms.\n- Some rooms have a penalty for entering, reducing the total reward.\n- The goal is to maximize the total reward within the time limit."
