The facility has 20 rooms, and each room has a unique reward value. The goal is to find the path that maximizes the total reward. The facility also has the following constraints:\n\n1. Some rooms are locked and can only be accessed after visiting specific other rooms.\n2. Some rooms have a time limit for entry, after which they become inaccessible.\n3. Some rooms have a cooldown period after which"
